# How to Avoid Furniture Damage During a Local Move

Moving house is stressful enough without worrying about scratched tables, broken chairs, or damaged sofas. While a local move might seem easier than a long-distance relocation, your furniture is still at risk if not handled properly. Whether you’re doing it yourself or hiring professional **Brisbane removalists**, taking the right steps can save you time, money, and regret.

Here are some practical tips to help you protect your furniture during your next local move.

## 1. Plan Ahead and Take Inventory

Before moving day, walk through your home and make a list of all your furniture. Identify fragile or valuable items like antiques, glass tables, or anything with sentimental value. This helps you prepare the right packing materials and lets your **furniture removalists** know what needs extra care.

You should also measure doorways, hallways, and staircases to avoid tight squeezes or awkward turns that could lead to bumps or scratches.

## 2. Disassemble When Possible

Large furniture items like beds, dining tables, and bookshelves are easier and safer to move when broken down into smaller parts. Remove table legs, take apart bed frames, and unscrew shelves if needed. Store all screws and bolts in clearly labeled bags.

Disassembling furniture reduces the chances of damage during loading and unloading, and makes it easier to wrap and protect each piece properly.

## 3. Use Quality Packing Materials

Don’t cut corners on packing supplies. Use moving blankets, bubble wrap, stretch wrap, and furniture pads to cushion and cover your items. These materials protect against scratches, dents, and dirt.

- **Blankets and pads**: Ideal for wooden furniture or delicate finishes.
- **Stretch wrap**: Holds drawers and doors shut on dressers and cabinets.
- **Corner protectors**: Perfect for glass tables, mirrors, or anything with sharp edges.

If you're hiring [**local Brisbane furniture removalists**](https://ozwidemovers.com/furniture-removalists), confirm that they provide these materials or if you need to supply your own.

## 4. Label and Handle Fragile Items With Care

If an item is fragile or particularly valuable, make sure it's clearly labeled. Point these out to your movers before they start loading the truck. When moving yourself, always lift and carry heavy items with proper technique—using your legs, not your back—and avoid dragging furniture on floors, which can damage both the item and the flooring.

## 5. Use the Right Moving Equipment

The right tools can make a huge difference. Use dollies for heavy furniture, sliders for large pieces across floors, and straps to secure items inside the truck. These tools not only protect your furniture but also reduce the physical strain on you or your movers.

Most **professional removalists in Brisbane** will come equipped with this gear, but if you’re doing it solo, you can rent or purchase them from hardware stores or moving supply shops.

## 6. Secure Furniture in the Truck

Loading the moving truck correctly is key to preventing damage. Place heavier items on the bottom and stack lighter ones on top. Make sure everything is tightly packed so nothing shifts during transport.

Use tie-downs or ropes to secure furniture to the truck walls. If there’s too much open space, fill it with soft items like blankets, mattresses, or pillows to act as shock absorbers.

## 7. Hire Experienced Brisbane Removalists

Hiring professional **furniture removalists** is often the safest option—especially if you have large or delicate items. Look for [**Brisbane removalists**](https://ozwidemovers.com/local-removalists/brisbane-removalist) with solid reviews and experience in handling local moves. Ask if they’re insured and what steps they take to protect your belongings.

Although it might seem more expensive upfront, the cost of fixing or replacing damaged furniture can be much higher.

**Remember**: It’s not just about getting everything from Point A to Point B—it’s about making sure your belongings arrive in the same condition they left.
